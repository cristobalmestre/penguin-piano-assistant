**Piano Assitant Execute instructions and must-knows**

All of the installed libraries can be found at the config_assitant.py file, plus detailed instructions for instaling the compiling libraries.
The program was tested with Python 3.11.4 on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspian Os.

1. To run the code you need to download the five ".py" files and unzip the "Piano Learning Assistant Project folders.zip" file in the same folder.
2. The config_assitant.py file controls the name of the working directory. You must update it there.
3. Execute the "execute_sequence-py" file, that will use all the others. All libraries need to end up properly installed for the whole program to run correctly.
